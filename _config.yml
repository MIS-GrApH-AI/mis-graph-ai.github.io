  The emerging uses of artificial intelligence are transforming many industries, but the healthcare sector lags behind this progress partly because the production databases holding patient data are too poorly organized to run artificial intelligence algorithms. To address this problem, we have organized an open, sharing community of physicians, data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, students, and others inspired by a common vision: to make healthcare data AI-friendly from the ground up.<br><br>
  We are working use-case by use-case with real patient data to build a foundation of knowledge, a toolkit, and a corps of colleagues to act as a springboard for real-world implementations. In addition to use cases, we work to address global issues such as human-machine interfaces and knowledge graphing.<br><br>
