- The C-BIA interns have chosen the project [Incorporate existing data sources into a UMLS-based knowledge graph](https://github.com/MIS-GrApH-AI/Public/projects/1) 
- The C-BIA interns would like to work on the graph visualization project, but probably would not start until they have made significant progress on their first project
- Nikesh showed the group what the C-BIA interns have found so far in their preliminary investigations of RxNorm, MeSH, MED-RT, and UMLS
- The group agreed to begin work on the project [Extract relationships among UMLS concepts from the world's medical literature](https://github.com/MIS-GrApH-AI/Public/projects/2) in parallel with the C-BIA interns' project(s)
