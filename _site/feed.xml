To address this problem, we have organized an open, sharing community of physicians, data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, students, and others inspired by a common vision: to make healthcare data AI-friendly from the ground up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We are working use-case by use-case with real patient data to build a foundation of knowledge, a toolkit, and a corps of colleagues to act as a springboard for real-world implementations. In addition to use cases, we work to address global issues such as human-machine interfaces and knowledge graphing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you are interested in joining the working group, please contact Tim McLerran at tmclerran@gmail.com or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-mclerran/).
