<meta name="description" content="The emerging uses of artificial intelligence are transforming many industries, but the healthcare sector lags behind this progress partly because the production databases holding patient data are too poorly organized to run artificial intelligence algorithms. To address this problem, we have organized an open, sharing community of physicians, data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, students, and others inspired by a common vision: to make healthcare data AI-friendly from the ground up. We are working use-case by use-case with real patient data to build a foundation of knowledge, a toolkit, and a corps of colleagues to act as a springboard for real-world implementations. In addition to use cases, we work to address global issues such as human-machine interfaces and knowledge graphing.

  <h1>What new clinical trials (or treatment or medical technology) can I recommend my patient to enroll or consider?
</h1>
</header>

<p>What should I do next to work up this patientâ€™s problem? ðŸ“·</p>

<p>As a clinician (doctor, pharmacist, PA, APRN, etc.) caring for a patient whose medical problem may qualify them for emerging interventions (treatments, devices).</p>

<p>I want to know what clinical trials or newly approved interventions exist</p>

<p>so that I can refer my patient to and counsel them about the trials (or new intervention) with the most potential to improve their outcome with the least possible cost (in terms of time, money, patient discomfort, etc).</p>

<p>Possible approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>capture clinical trial data from disease-defined registries (e.g. clinicaltrial.gov)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>link patient data to potential trails or new interventions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>elicit a list of data points which may align patient variables to available trial data (outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Acceptance criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prioritize list of ongoing trials or new treatments (or recent trial data) according to value vs cost</li>
</ul>
