      of Human-Graphs Interface</h1>
    <p>Etienne Saliez, version 2021-09-01 /</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction:
        <ul>
          <li>There is a need of bridges between:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>Humans graphs:<br />
                <ul>
                  <li>At one side the human mind works as a large graph of
                    neurons with about 10**12 neurons i.e. nodes and 10**15
                    synapses i.e. relationships.</li>
                  <li>Medical users need very easy interface to edit graphs.
                    Technical formulations like "cypher statements" would
                    absolutely not be accepted.</li>
                  <li>Humans are excellent at visual pattern recognition i.e.
                    graphs.</li>
                  <li>People should be encouraged at providing more structured
                    information. May be still free text but at least in small
                    dedicated boxes. The idea is here to reduce the need of very
                    unstructured "natural language" analysis with all its
                    complexity.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Computers graphs:<br />
                <ul>
                  <li>At the other side computers need also graphs in order to
                    manage complex information. </li>
                  <li>Computer should provide very flexible and interactive
                    graph presentations in order to be easily understood by
                    people. </li>
                  <li>In order to be trusted, computers must be very
                    transparent, explaining recommended decisions step by step.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Main intended uses:
            <ul>
              <li>Knowledge base:
                <ul>
                  <li>Builders and maintainers of medical knowledge graphs which
                    require many relationships between concepts. </li>
                  <li>Even if Natural Language Processing of textbooks can
                    provide a good start for knowledge bases, medical experts
                    will remain very necessary for review and corrections.</li>
                  <li>Teachers of medicine have to explain to their students
                    multiple relations between concepts. They could like to use
                    graphs in the preparation of their courses. Also expected to
                    be useful in traing sessions.</li>
                  <li>A knowledge base is intended to contain generic knowledge
                    about symptoms, problems, actions, ... For example knowledge
                    about the meaning of a lab test appear only once in the
                    knowledge base.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Patient record:
                <ul>
                  <li>During contacts with patients notes must always be
                    registered immediately. Rather than doing that typing
                    completely free text the idea is to try to do it in a more
                    structured way as a graph. Of course this option require a
                    very ergonomic interface. Some NLP could help but the goal
                    is anyhow to create graphs.</li>
                  <li>The expected benefit is to get instantly Assisted
                    Intelligence from the medical knowledge base.  </li>
                  <li>A task oriented approach in order to try to solve the
                    problems of the patient. Problems have a central role with
                    links to symptoms and recommended actions. This according to
                    the "Problem Oriented Medical Record" according of L. Weed
                    philosophy.</li>
                  <li>Shared overview of patient's problems and related
                    information will be also very useful for the coordination
                    between the members of the "care team" in charge of a common
                    patient.</li>
                  <li>A patient record is intended to contain instances of
                    information related to a particular patient, as problems,
                    symptoms, treatments, .... These instances are in principle
                    always linked to the corresponding generic knowledge. For
                    example there may be any number of instances of lab test
                    results found by many different patients, at different
                    times.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>General remarks:
            <ul>
              <li>This document is intended to define the desirable
                functionalities while a separate note will look at software
                resources. </li>
              <li>Real time interactivity is essential in patient care.</li>
              <li>Graphs must contain the complete information even if some
                fields are not yet well structured.  Anyhow graphs are seen as
                backbone or as a "kind of table of content" at the top level,
                paying much attention to relations between main concepts
                represented by nodes. That said nodes may contain any kind of a
                mittle less structured information including free text comments,
                images, or links to external documents.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Screen:
        <ul>
          <li>Visual graphs should be the backbone of this man-machine
            interface. </li>
          <li>A secondary screen space is intended to present and to update the
            attributes of a nodes or a relations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Main menu:
        <ul>
          <li>A persistent specific small group of nodes on fixed location on
            top of the screen.
            <ul>
              <li>Main commands, like seek a patient, get the problems,
                predefined selections, get agenda, user preferences, etc...</li>
              <li>The main menu should always be available. At least one node
                which can be expanded to a larger set of less frequent commands.</li>
              <li>Possibility to go back to the previous transactions. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>User preferences:
            <ul>
              <li>Selection of certain types of relationships.</li>
              <li>Default selection at the opening of a patient record.</li>
              <li>Preferred style of presentation.</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Selections:
        <ul>
          <li>Selection of a subset of the large databases. For example
            selection in the knowledge base of one disease, of related symptoms,
            recommended actions, ..., or in case of a patient record selection
            of one problem with directly related information.</li>
          <li>Zoom or un-zoom should provide more or less, from a large overview
            to the details.</li>
          <li>By default the active node or relation is presented with most of
            his directly related nodes. However users may define preferences
            about types of relations and number of levels.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Current object:
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction:
            <ul>
              <li>The current active object may be a node or a relation,
                presented as highlighted.</li>
              <li>Remark: access and updates of objects will depend on the
                current user profile and of the transaction type. The exact
                rules will be specified in a separate document according to
                "Role Based Access Control" principles. Typically the current
                "care team" of the patient need access to work. For example a
                nurse need to read the prescriptions but not to create new ones.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Flying over:
            <ul>
              <li>Show temporarily the content of the node or relation in the
                secondary window. Intended to make very easy to see quickly the
                essential of the content.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Activation:
            <ul>
              <li>Presentation of the content as above, but in a more persistent
                way, until a save or a close.</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Actions on a node:
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation to a new selection.
                <ul>
                  <li>For example a new specific selection to related nodes
                    starting from the current node,. </li>
                  <li>Access to previous versions of the same node, if any.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Access to the full content of the node:
                <ul>
                  <li>The content of node begin with a few standard information
                    as type, date-time, responsible author, etc... and may
                    include any kind of document, discharge letters , images,
                    etc...</li>
                  <li>If necessary a cursor in order to see more of a long
                    screen page.</li>
                  <li>Possibility to jump to related pages, even on an external
                    server. i.e. hypertext facilities, with later come back.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Possibility to edit the content:
                <ul>
                  <li>A set of fields can be proposed:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Some field could accept expression in natural
                        language. Or even maybe voice converted immediately to
                        text.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Some standard fields may be mandatory while additional
                    fields are optional.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Procedures and rules:
                <ul>
                  <li>In a medical knowledge base, it must be possible to
                    install procedures inside nodes.</li>
                  <li>The specification of these procedures will be discussed in
                    an other chapter about decision procedures.</li>
                  <li>Activation:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Manual in the edit window, in function of predefined
                        changes in the attributes, by "events" coming from other
                        procedures, ...</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Consequences:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Possibility to activate new selections, to create new
                        nodes and relations, to broadcast new events, ...</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Save:
                <ul>
                  <li>If a previous version exist of the same object exist,
                    generate a new version.</li>
                  <li>Previous versions should remain available on request.
                    Indeed it must be possible to retrieve the situation as it
                    was at a given point in time in the past. Important in the
                    context of a team of several actors who may sometimes have
                    different opinions. Moreover a legal requirement in order to
                    justify a decision based on available information at that
                    time.</li>
                  <li>Changes in nodes could activate evaluation procedures.</li>
                  <li>Deprecation:
                    <ul>
                      <li>In principle delete should never be allowed
                        immediately.</li>
                      <li>Relations to a nodes must have already been
                        deprecated.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Close:</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Actions on a Relation: <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Similar to nodes here above.</li>
              <li>Also flyover for quick inspection.</li>
              <li>Standardization of the types of relations. A set of relations
                types will be defined, pay</li>
              <li>ing much attention to the difference between causal or only
                co-occurence relations.</li>
              <li>Weight of relations:
                <ul>
                  <li>Very important in evaluation procedures; In patient care
                    uncertainties are very common and many things are never
                    completely "yes" or "no". </li>
                  <li>Weight representation:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Inside the database weights should be normalized in a
                        scale from 0 to 1. Indeed decision procedures should be
                        based on the best possible values.</li>
                      <li>On visual graph by means of the thickness of arrows.</li>
                      <li>In traditional reports the score should be rounded to
                        adjectives, like "weak" or "strong", "not to exclude" or
                        "certain", ...</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Weight could have several factors having each their own
                    weight. For example "degree of belief" is different from
                    "probability". "Importance" can be seen from different point
                    of view as life expectancy and comfort.</li>
                  <li><br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Relations are to be seen as independent objects. For example
                the author or a Relation may be different from the authors of
                the 2 related nodes.</li>
              <li>The same 2 nodes may have multiple relations. For example when
                2 authors have different vision on a relation.</li>
              <li>Relations have a direction, but traversal can be in both
                directions.</li>
              <li>As above changes in relations should be propagated to
                concerned evaluation procedures.</li>
              <li>Save or deprecate as above.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Creation of a Node:
        <ul>
          <li>May be created in an empty space, again depending on the
            authorization profile of the current user.</li>
          <li>Any new node must immediately be edited, at least with a type and
            the mandatory attributes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Creation of a Relation:
        <ul>
          <li>Drag an arrow from one node to an other one, again depending on
            the authorizations of the user.</li>
          <li>Any new relation must immediately be edited, at least with the
            mandatory attributes. </li>
          <li>Dragging an arrow to an empty location will create a new node.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Visual presentation:
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction:
            <ul>
              <li>In order to make a very intuitive visual interface the most
                important types and attributes should appear in a visual way, or
