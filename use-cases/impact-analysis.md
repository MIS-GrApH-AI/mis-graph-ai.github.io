  <h1>Impact analysis for treatment decisions based on current patient state and current treatments

As a physician caring for a patient with a current set of problems and treatments

I want a prediction of what problems are likely to develop next

so that I can prevent and proactively detect problems as early as possible.

Example:

Diabetic patients receiving high-dose steroids and antibiotics subsequently develop severe fungal infections. Can we predict who is likely to develop fungal infection and perhaps recommend
specific actions to prevent the fungal infection?
