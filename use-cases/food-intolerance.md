  <h1>Food intolerance prediction
</h1>

As a nutritionist caring for a patient with a poorly defined food intolerance

I want to know which foods the patient can eat and which foods they should avoid

so that the patient can feel well.

Possible approach:

Starting with a severely restricted diet, reintroduce foods one at a time. As intolerances to specific foods are discovered, use these as inputs to predict the minimal set of foods that will be necessary to test on the patient to define their entire set of food intolerances.
