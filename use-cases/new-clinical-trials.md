  <h1>What new clinical trials (or treatment or medical technology) can I recommend my patient to enroll or consider?

What should I do next to work up this patient's problem? ðŸ“·

As a clinician (doctor, pharmacist, PA, APRN, etc.) caring for a patient whose medical problem may qualify them for emerging interventions (treatments, devices).

I want to know what clinical trials or newly approved interventions exist

so that I can refer my patient to and counsel them about the trials (or new intervention) with the most potential to improve their outcome with the least possible cost (in terms of time, money, patient discomfort, etc).

Possible approach:

- capture clinical trial data from disease-defined registries (e.g. clinicaltrial.gov)

- link patient data to potential trails or new interventions

- elicit a list of data points which may align patient variables to available trial data (outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria)

Acceptance criteria:

- prioritize list of ongoing trials or new treatments (or recent trial data) according to value vs cost
