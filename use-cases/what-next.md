  <h1>What should I do next to work up this patient's problem?
</h1>
</header>

As a physician caring for a patient whose problem is undiagnosed

I want to know what additional data I will need

so that I can arrive at the most likely diagnosis with the least possible cost (in terms of time, money, patient discomfort, etc).

Possible approach:

- capture the relevant data that is already known

- link known data to possible problems

- elicit a list of data points which may confirm or exclude the possible problems

Acceptance criteria:

- prioritize list of needed data according to diagnostic value vs cost
