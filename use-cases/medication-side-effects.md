  <h1>Find out which patient problems likely come from medication side-effects or interactions
</h1>
</header>

As a physician or pharmacist caring for a patient who is already taking come medications

I want to know which of their problems may be the result of medication side effects or interactions

so that I can understand the causes of my patient's problems and manage the problem accordingly

Examples:

- Patient is prescribed a medication that prolongs the QT interval and returns later with arrhythmia. Knowing what is causing the QT prolongation allows us to discontinue the offending medication (see https://crediblemeds.org/)

- Patient is prescribed a medication that causes atrial fibrillation, is then prescribed an anticoagulant, and then has a bleeding event. Could we identify the first drug as the cause of atrial fibrillation and discontinue it instead of adding an anticoagulant?
