  <h1>Create a running summary of the patient's problems

As a physician caring for this patient

I want to see an up-to-date summary of the patient's problems and course

so that I can quickly understand the patient's situation and treat them with an understanding of their whole context

Acceptance criteria:

- Combine problems on the list that are referring to the same problem

- prioritize the list according to the provider who is viewing it (e.g. GI problems higher for GI physician)

- show relationships among the patient's problems to highlight interdependencies

- prioritize problems related to highest risk of the worst outcomes like death
